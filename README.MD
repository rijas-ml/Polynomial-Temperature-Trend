Polynomial Temperature Trend

Overview
This project demonstrates how  Polynomial Regression  models  non-linear climate patterns  predicting monthly temperature variations across a year.

What It Does
 Creates synthetic monthly temperature data (Jan–Dec)
 Fits both Linear & Polynomial Regression models
 Compares performance using R² Score
 Visualizes how polynomial curves fit seasonal trends

Libraries Used
 numpy  
 matplotlib  
 scikit-learn  

 Key Takeaways
 Linear models fail to capture non-linear seasonal trends  
 Polynomial Regression provides a better curve fit  
 Works well for time-based or cyclical datasets (like temperature, rainfall, demand)
